# Personal Wikipedia üìöüîç

Personal Wikipedia is a simple Python application that enables users to quickly retrieve summarized information from Wikipedia on any topic of interest. It provides both text-based summaries and offers the option to listen to the information through text-to-speech functionality.

## Features:
- **User Input:** Input any topic of interest to retrieve information from Wikipedia.
- **Wikipedia Integration:** Fetch summarized articles directly from Wikipedia's database.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Convert the retrieved summary into speech for easy listening.
- **Customizable:** Extend functionality with additional features such as language selection or error handling.

## How to Use:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Python script `python AbuzarGPT.py`.
4. Enter the topic you want to search for when prompted.
5. View the summary printed in the console and listen to it through the text-to-speech functionality.

## Dependencies:
- `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech functionality.
- `wikipedia`: For accessing Wikipedia's database.

## Future Improvements:
- GUI Implementation for a more user-friendly experience.
- Enhanced error handling for informative messages.
- Language support for querying Wikipedia in multiple languages.
- Advanced text-to-speech options like voice selection or speed control.

## Note:
Ensure proper internet connectivity for accessing Wikipedia's database.
